The app will then show the plants and planting information for your area. You can drag and drop your plant choices into the square garden map to plan your future garden.

## Technologies
This project used [USDA Plant Hardiness Zones API](https://rapidapi.com/aptitudeapps/api/usda-plant-hardiness-zones/) to access hardiness zone based off the users zip code. This app compiled plant data for the user from two databaes, [Companion Plants Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aramacus/companion-plants) and [Vegetables, Herbs, and Edible Flowers Database](https://data.world/sharon/vegetables-herbs-and-edible-flowers) to include plants name, alternate names, sowing instructions, plant spacing, harvesting instructions, hardiness zone, a plant image, and an external link to further help you in your gardening adventure.  


### USDA Plant Hardiness Zones API
Retrieves the USDA plant hardiness zone and average minimum winter temperature range for the given ZIP code.  
An example of this response:
```
{
  "zone": "6b",
  "min_temp_range": "-5F to 0F"
}
```
