# Garden2
An app to help you plan your square foot garden


Technolgies used:


## Description
- In this challenge I created a note taking app that is used to write and save notes. This app uses Express.js on the back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The future of this project:
- I plan to add the delete function to complete this app full circle.

---

## Technologies
node.js

express.js

To make a unique id when the user saves I used the npm package UUID.
